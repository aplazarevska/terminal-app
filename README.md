# Software Development Plan

6 pts

300-500 words:

DESIGNS a software development plan which states the purpose of the application and provides a list of functions/features that will be implemented in the application.

Software development plan states the purpose of the application WITH A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF CLARITY, providing a COMPREHENSIVE list of functions / features that will be implemented in the application.

A statement of purpose and scope for the app which includes:

- **describe** at a high level what the application will do
- **identify** the problem it will solve and **explain** why you are developing it
- **identify** the target audience
- **explain** how a member of the target audience will use it



# List of Features

6pts + 6pts

UTILISES variables and variable scope by declaring them correctly, assigning values to them, and utilising variable scope in block coding with control structures.

Uses variables by declaring and assigning values correctly and demonstrates A DEEP AND NUANCED UNDERSTANDING of scope by using variables correctly in block coding with control structures WHICH CONTAIN THEIR OWN SCOPED VARIABLES AND COMPLEX NESTED STRUCTURES

UTILISES loops and conditional control structures by using them correctly to manage control flow of an application.

Uses loops and conditional control structures to implement a control flow which has multiple paths and COMPLEX nested structures that handle multiple contingencies that manage the control flow of the application IN A HIGHLY EFFICIENT MANNER

at least THREE features and description about each

- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

# UX/UI Outline

6pts

PLANS user interactions with the application.

Outline of user interaction and experience for the application COMPREHENSIVELY outlines with a VERY HIGH LEVEL OF DETAIL how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature; how the user will interact with / use each feature; and how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user.

Must include:

- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user



# Control Flow Diagram

6pts

DESIGNS diagrams which explain the control flow in their application.

Diagram COMPREHENSIVELY shows the control flow of the application for ALL features of the application, and utilises a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram.

Must include:

- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.



# Implementation Plan

6pts + 6pts

OUTLINES how the functions/features described in the software development plan will be implemented.

Implementation plan VERY CLEARLY outlines how each feature will be implemented, providing a COMPREHENSIVE checklist of tasks for each feature; prioritises implementation of different features and/or checklist items within a feature; provides a deadline for each feature, checklist, and/or checklist item.

UTILISES project management software to track the development of an application.

Demonstrates SIGNIFICANT AND HIGHLY FREQUENT use of project management software to track the development of an application.

Must include:

- **outlines** how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item
- track it on Trello
  - Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.



# Help Documentation

6pts

DESIGNS appropriate documentation or help file for a user to utilise the features of the application.

Help file includes COMPREHENSIVE instructions which ACCURATELY describe: steps to install the application; dependencies required by the application; system/hardware requirements; features of the application.

set of instructions which accurately **describe** how to use and install the application.

must include:

- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
